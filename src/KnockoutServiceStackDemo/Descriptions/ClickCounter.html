<p>This sample shows how to create a simple model and apply multiple bindings that
  define view appearance depending on the certain state.</p>
<p>The sample calculates button clicks. When button is clicked 3 times it becomes
  inactive, instead the other button providing the ability to reset clicks number
  appears. Logic of click count is hosted on the server and is set by <code>RegisterClick</code>
  and <code>ResetClicks</code> methods. <code>HasClickedTooManyTimes</code> computed
  property is subscribed for the the property containing the number of clicks <code>
    NumberOfClicks</code>. It manages availability of the main button and ability
  to reset click number.</p>
